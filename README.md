# Langchain_TextSummarizer
**Langchain Model**

This repository contains code for working with the Langchain model to generate summaries of text documents. The Langchain model is based on the OpenAI GPT-3.5 architecture and is specifically designed for language-related tasks.

**Getting Started**

To use the Langchain model, follow these steps:

**Installation**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

pip install openai

pip install langchain

pip install tiktoken

3. Make sure you have a valid OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, sign up for OpenAI and generate your API key.

### **Usage**
1. Update the **openai\_api\_key** variable in the code with your OpenAI API key.
2. Specify the desired OpenAI API type, version, and base URL by modifying the **openai\_api\_type**, **openai\_api\_version**, and **openai\_api\_base** variables, respectively.
3. Set the **model\_name** variable to the desired Langchain model. The default value is "text-davinci-003".
4. Prepare your input text file by updating the **input\_text** variable with the path to your text file.
5. Run the code to load the Langchain model, split the text into documents, and generate summaries using the Langchain model.
6. The output will be stored in the **output** variable and can be further processed or utilized as needed.

**File Structure**

- **langchain\_model.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for working with the Langchain model.
- **README.md**: The README file providing information about the repository and instructions for usage.
- **apple.txt**: An example input text file. Replace this file with your own text file for summarization.
